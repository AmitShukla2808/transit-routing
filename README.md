### Introduction <img align="right" alt="GIF" height="100px" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/U4FkC2VqpeNRHjTDQ5/giphy.gif" />
This repository provides various efficient algorithms to solve bicriteria shortest path problem in public transit routing. 
We mainly focus on two popular approaches- Round-Based Public Transit Routing (RAPTOR) and Trip-Based public
Transit Routing (TBTR) working on arrival time and number of transfers as the two optimization criteria.
Apart from the already published HypRAPTOR, we also include our variant of HypTBTR. Furthermore, both HypRAPTOR and HypTBTR have been extended to multilevel 
nested partitioning scheme (NhypTBTR and NhypRAPTOR).

Additionally, to make the RAPTOR and TBTR approach more practical, we also include One-To-Many rTBTR and One-To-Many rRAPTOR. These not only reduce the preprocessing times of the partitioning variants but also significantly
outperform the existing approach for location-based queries (as a location can have multiple stops near it)

Switzerland's public transit network has been provided as test case. Figure below shows the transit stop location (left) and 4-way partitioning using KaHyPar (right).
